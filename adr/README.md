# Architecture Decision Records

## Huh ?

Yup, remember [this tech radar link one off your _crafter_ coworker sent you like a few years ago](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records "well it's the ðŸ’£, use it ...") ?

Well this is my flavour of it. There's nothing revolutionnary about it but it's the one I use because it makes sense to me.

# Where can I read said ADR-s ?
[There's a list there.](decisions/. "look AAAAALL THE DECISIONS !")

## This reminds me of something, I've seen some similar files somewhere already, haven't I ?

Yes ... yes you likely have ... I've taken a strong inspiration (almost shamelessly yanked before deciding to rework it)
from [gov.uk's aws deploy project](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws "sometimes you find the unexpected-est things in the weirdest of places of all things ... go figure ...")
and more specifically [this file](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/blob/24d1ea513e58ee938043d71d09815a51229067bf/docs/architecture/README.md "Thanks ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ gov, I hope you don't mind me taking inspiration from you, I hope this is still considered inspiration and not plagiarism, if not I'll change what needs to when needed, but as of right now I feel like I've written this very file (or similar, more personal, versions of it) like 50 times to help people here and there and never pushed it anywhere not once and now I can't write it one more time, I'm drained ... so ... what's lost around comes around I guess ? And I mention you ... so it's something ... Anyhoo in case you ever feel about this let me know.").
